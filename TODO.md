# TO-DO

- Copy my script to create Edge cleanup task in Windows.
  - Even necessary still? Was it only because of Edge-Dev/Beta?
- Use `scriptEnv` to avoid some `.tmpl` files. Example [here](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/use-scripts-to-perform-actions/#understand-how-scripts-work#set-environment-variables).

## Maybe

- Support Windows PowerShell in addition to PowerShell core.
- Use `.chezmoiignore` to handle per-OS configuration. Example [here](https://github.com/twpayne/dotfiles/commit/c550eddaf5d1cb2d3f105e10bfb305f370ee177c).
